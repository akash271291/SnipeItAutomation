# SnipeItAutomation by AKASHDEEP

This project implements automated UI testing for the Snipe-IT demo asset management system using .NET 8, Microsoft Playwright, and NUnit. 

##  Objective

The automation script performs the following steps:

1. Logs into the Snipe-IT demo site at [https://demo.snipeitapp.com/login](https://demo.snipeitapp.com/login)
2. Creates a new asset: **Macbook Pro 13"**
3. Sets the asset status to **Ready to Deploy**
4. Checks out the asset to a **random user and location**
5. Verifies the asset exists in the asset list
6. Opens the asset details page and confirms key information
7. Navigates to the **History** tab and validates expected entries

## Credentials Used (Demo Site)

The demo login credentials used in the script are:

- Username: admin

##  Notes

 -The asset name is dynamically generated with a timestamp to ensure uniqueness during each test run.
 -The tests run in **headed mode** (`Headless = false`) so you can observe the browser as it performs the steps.
